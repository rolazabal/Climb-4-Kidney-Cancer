# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Health data setup (Android + iOS)

The app now includes health integrations in the Progress tab (`app/(tabs)/progress.tsx`) through a wrapper service (`services/health-connect.ts`):
- Android: `react-native-health-connect`
- iOS: `react-native-health` (Apple HealthKit)

1. Install the package:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-health-connect react-native-health
   ```

2. Build a development client (required for native modules):

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

3. Start Metro:

   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client
   ```

Notes:
- Health integrations will not work in Expo Go because they require native modules.
- iOS HealthKit permissions/entitlements are configured in `app.json` (`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`, `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`, and `com.apple.developer.healthkit` entitlement).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
